Bimbo: a bare minimal HTML+CSS boilerplate
==========================================
The Minimal Boilerplate, The Whole Minimal Boilerplate, and Nothing But The Minimal Boilerplate

About Naming:
-------------
Well, it sits there & looks pretty &mdash; doesn't do anything useful (directly). You only *need* her at times to initiate new projects.

Why New Boilerplate:
--------------------
I'm not reinventing &mdash; just redesigning the perfect wheels for **my** McLaren F1, because clobbering those general purpose sedan wheels to fit this is a fucking waste of time (each time).
